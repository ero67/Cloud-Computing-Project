# Cloud-Computing-Project

Implementing multi-stage deployment pipeline with comprehensive monitoring infrastructure for a web application.

## Project Scope

### Git Flow Strategy
- Main branch (production)
- Develop branch (integration)
- Feature branches
- Release branches
- Hotfix branches

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Development Environment**
  - Automated deployments
  - Integration testing

- **Production Environment**
  - Manual promotion
  - Blue-green deployment
  - Rollback capability

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**
  - Metrics collection
  - Health checks
  - Alert rules

- **Grafana**
  - Real-time dashboards
  - System metrics
  - Custom alerts
